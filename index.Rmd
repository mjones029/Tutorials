## Welcome!

This website is intended for sharing various tutorials for the analysis and presentation of ecological data. Basically everything you see here will be based in the R programming language, with the occasionally use of other software tools. 


## About me
I am a research scientist in Dr. Wendy Turner's lab at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I study white-tailed deer movement ecology and chronic wasting disease transmission. I previously completed my DVM/PhD dual-degree at the University of Minnesota. In my dissertation research with Dr. Meggan Craft, I studied feline retrovirus transmission dynamics in the endangered Florida panther.  

More broadly, I study the drivers and dynamics of infectious disease transmission in wildlife. My work is highly interdisciplinary, drawing from bioinformatics, movement ecology, disease ecology, and veterinary medicine, and I have extensive experience in network and computational modeling.  

You can learn more about me at my [main website](www.marieljgilbertson.weebly.com) and see the most up-to-date list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-81O6EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.
